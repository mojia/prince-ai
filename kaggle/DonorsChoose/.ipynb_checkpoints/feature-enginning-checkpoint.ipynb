We are a Title I school of approximately 900 students and we are continuing to grow! At our school, we value student diversity and celebrate the leader in each of our students. We were recently awarded Lighthouse Status as a \\\"Leader In Me\\\" School and have received many awards for closing the achievement gap and raising test scores. We are working towards creating a world class Fine Arts program for our students, so they can find their voice and explore their creativity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        An important part of a student's music education experience is performance. At our school, we try to give students the chance to perform as often as possible. Our students are leaders, they love to be in the spotlight!  There is nothing we enjoy more than handing our students a microphone and letting them shine! We are limited, however, because we do not have a portable sound system. Without one, our student performers can't be heard and we can't play accompaniment tracks. The Fender Passport Event Portable Sound System is a good quality system that would provide us the opportunity to perform for audiences anywhere!

My classes serves students with a range of disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, emotional disturbance, autism spectrum disorder and specific learning disabilities.  It supports students who struggle with grasping the academics in a general education setting.  Typically this means the world comes to fast at them, or sideways, and they just need my classroom to slow things down to give them time to understand.

Headphones are a vital tool in our classroom. In our classroom, we use Chromebooks every day and often have activities that involved listening to stories or websites or videos.  This means students need headphones. Without headphones, it becomes a cacophony of sound and students would struggle to listen to their own activity.  \\r\\nWe also use Time for Kids magazine every week.  It's a great tool to look at and analyze nonfiction text.  It also makes current events interesting and relevant to students. \\r\\nThe donations for this project will improve my classroom by providing the appropriate tools for student learning.  It will allow the instruction to be differentiated and students to be pushed to their furthest academic abilities.

My student are lucky enough that we have a theater program, but they could grow even more with better funding.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThese students work very hard every year to create meaningful performances for their community, but we are often limited as to what we can do because of budgetary issues.  They are extremely creative in their theatrical performance skills, but many of them show a passion not just for performing.  Many students yearn for technical theater skills as well (such as drafting, electrics work, sound design, set construction, costume construction, etc.), but in order to teach the students these technical skills, we have to have materials.  Please help us fund their knowledge and growth!\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Theater classes are a great means of expression and creation for many students, but should that creation and expression be confined to only performance based work?\\r\\n\\r\\nThese materials would be utilized to teach students the basics of drafting and design through model making and scenic design activities.  These activities not only make the students more well rounded if they chose to pursue a degree in theater, but it also creates valuable geometry, critical thinking, design, and construction skills.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the activities that would be conducted utilizing these materials are model making with shapes do understand the concepts and principles of design in both 2 and 3 dimensions.

We have a saying that my students love to repeat every day: \\\"to learn in this class, we roll up our sleeves, get our feet wet and get our hands dirty!\\\"  We \\\"huddle-up\\\" and recite this chant each morning to set a tone of excitement and anticipation for the day.  \\r\\n\\r\\nMy students love technology and cannot wait to get their hands on it every day!  They are 21st Century learners, raised with technology embedded into almost every aspect of their lives and to learn without it would be completely alien to them!   They become completely immersed in their learning when technology is involved.   Technology connects my students to the world far beyond what I can teach them or what a text book can provide.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo keep my students engaged and excited about their learning, I divide my 24 students into four (ever-changing) cooperative learning groups.  Students spend the lion's share of their day rotating through a variety of hands-on learning activities that include technology, small group direct-instruction, educational games, movement, and inquiry every day.  \\r\\n  Some of the Apps that we will use on our iPads include Raz-Kids, aka Reading A-Z which is an adaptive reading program that provides students with interactive on-line books to practice reading at their individual reading levels. My students are just learning to read in first grade and they need A LOT of practice!  \\r\\n\\r\\nMany students do not have appropriate reading material at their reading level at home to practice with and the iPads will provide that much needed practice.  Students will also use the iPads to access MobyMax, an interactive and adaptive application to supplement math, reading, writing, and language support at each students individual learning level, during our rotations. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, my school has recently adopted the STEAM instructional approach, which is an acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts, and Mathematics.  Technology will now become an even more integral piece of my daily instruction and the iPads will support this new STEAM emphasis.  Using the iPads, students will be able to produce ebooks, and iMovies to demonstrate their learning across the curriculum.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith these iPads, my students' learning experiencees will be enhanced tremendously and ensure that they are familiar with and able to use technology throughout their educational career.   I can guarantee that these iPads will be used by all of my students on a daily basis and will have a monumental impact on their learning.\\r\\n             NaN             NaN                       My students need 3 Mini Apple iPads to enhance and support their learning in reading and phonics skills, math, and science.                                             0                    1\n",

I teach at a second chance school for students who are trying to keep up with their education while they have been excluded from their neighborhood schools.

Over the course of the year, I will teach approximately 200  high school students. \\r\\n\\r\\nMany of my students have had negative school experiences and have given up on themselves.

When given the tools to be successful my students begin their year knowing there are people who care about their education. It helps them care more. I truly saw that impact this year.
